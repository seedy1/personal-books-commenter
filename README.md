# Checkpoints report for the project

You **MUST** append a filled copy of this document at the end of your `README.MD`.

This document serves three main purposes:
- providing you a clear list of my expectations (check each point when done) ;
- ensuring I do not miss some of your engineering during the review ;
- asking for additional information that helps me during the review.

## Notice

Check every applicable checkbox in the above list. For each one, provide the requested additional information.

In your explanation, please provide links (file + line) to relevant parts of your source code and tests if applicable.

### Caption

ðŸ”µ means the checkbox is mandatory. If missing or absolutely not satisfying, it may cost you 0.5 penalty point.

## Expectations

### GraphQL API only

- [ ] Reduce code duplication for the various involved schemas (of the database, of the ORM, of GraphQL...). **[1 point]** ðŸ”µ
> How did you achieve this?

- [ ] Mitigation(s) against too complex GraphQL queries, arbitrary deep nested object fetching or related DoS. **[1 point per mitigation, up to 2]**
> Quote and explain each mitigation.

- [ ] Any security or performance improvement related to your GraphQL implementation, as optionally highlighted in the subject? points]**
> Explain each improvement.

### Input validation

- [x] Strictly and deeply validate the type of every input (`params, querystring, body`) at runtime before any processing. **[1 point]** ðŸ”µ
> How did you achieve this?

I achieved this by using fastify's input validator. I do this by first creating a JSON schema with the accedpted fields and their types. Example src\schemas\json\user.json file is used to validate input src\routes\auth.ts in line 23. This is used in all places where an input is required. For Params I also did the same as seen in src\schemas\json\queryId.json which can been seen in src\routes\book.ts line 38.

----------------------
- [x] Ensure the type of every input can be inferred by Typescript at any time and properly propagates across the app. **[1 point]** ðŸ”µ
> How did you achieve this?

I achieved this using the json2ts package-https://www.npmjs.com/package/json2ts. When ever I updated a schema I ran `npm gentypes` which would generate/update the types from the JSON schemas.

- [ ] Ensure the static and runtime input types are always synced. **[1 point]** ðŸ”µ
> How did you achieve this? If extra commands must be run before the typescript checking, how do you ensure there are run?

To do this one just simply runs `npm gentypes`. To do this automatically I can watch the schema schema files for any changes and run `npm gentypes`.

### Authorisation

- [x] Check the current user is allowed to call this endpoint. **[1 point]** ðŸ”µ
> How did you achieve this?

I achieve this by using fastify hooks and prehandler at the same time as seen in src\routes\user.ts line 17.

- [x] Check the current user is allowed to perform the action on a specific resource. **[1 point]** ðŸ”µ
> How did you achieve this?
I achieve this by first checking if the user is logged in, then I check if the user owns the resource to make changes. I do this in line 91. I checked if the book user id is the same as the current users ID.


- [x] Did you build or use an authorisation framework, making the authorisation widely used in your code base? **[1 point]**
> How did you achieve this?

I used a combination of fastify-session and fastify-cookie to handle my authentication. It is injected into the fastify code so available throughtout my code/app. In the file src\lib\fastify.ts from line 24-31 I register the authentication 'protocols' to the fastify server/app which makes it available in all of my codebase.


- [ ] Do you have any way to ensure authorisation is checked on every endpoint? **[1 point]**
> It is pretty easy to forget authorising some action.
> For obvious reasons, it may lead to security issues and bugs.
> At work, we use `varvet/pundit` in our `Ruby on Rails` stack. It can raise exception just before answering the client if authorisation is not checked.

> How did you achieve this?

### Secret and configuration management

- [x] Use a hash for any sensitive data you do not need to store as plain text. ðŸ”µ
> Also check this if you do not store any password or such data (and say it here).

I did hash all sensitive data (only have password as a sensitive data) and stored their hashed value in the database, and not their plain text form. To acheive this I used TYPEORMs beforeSave)() hook to hash any password. See src\models\Users.ts the method starting at line 36.

- [x] Store your configuration entries in environment variables or outside the git scope. **[1 point]** ðŸ”µ
> How did you achieve this?

I used te .env package which enables me to keep configuration variables outside git scope.

- [x] Do you provide a way to list every configuration entries (setup instructions, documentation, requireness... are appreciated)? **[1 point]**
> How did you achieve this?

Yes on top of this README.md file I give configuration instructions to be able to run the application.

- [ ] Do you have a kind of configuration validation with meaningful error messages? **[1 point]**
> How did you achieve this?

### Package management

- [x] Do not use any package with less than 50k downloads a week. ðŸ”µ

No :-)

- [x] Did you write some automated tools that check no unpopular dependency was installed? If yes, ensure it runs frequently. **[1 point]**
> How did you achieve this? A Github Action (or similar) and compliance rule for pull requests are appreciated.

I did not.

- [x] Properly use dependencies and devDevepencies in your package.json. **[0.5 points]**
> How did you achieve this?

I made sure to use --save-dev for packages which would only be used for development purposes and npm will put them in the devDevepencies section.

### Automated API generation

- [ ] Do you have automated documentation generation for your API (such as OpenAPI/Swagger...)? **[1 point]** ðŸ”µ
  -- provide json export
> How did you achieve this?
> You must link your documentation for review (a Github page, a ZIP archive, an attachment to the release notes...).

- [ ] In addition to requireness and types, do you provide a comment for every property of your documentation? **[1 point]**
> How did you achieve this?

- [ ] Do you document the schema of responses (at least for success codes) and provide examples of payloads? **[1 point]**
> How did you achieve this?

- [ ] Is your documentation automatically built and published when a commit reach the develop or master branches? **[1 point]**
> How did you achieve this?

### Error management

- [x] Do not expose internal application state or code (no sent stacktrace in production!). **[1 point]** ðŸ”µ
> How did you achieve this?
I achieved this in two ways; The first was to implement a custom validator and made sure no internal server state was exposed.
 The second is to turn off fastify logging. The best way to acheive this is to use the SET NODE_ENV=production file ... and set this is false using an .env file import.

- [ ] Do you report errors to Sentry, Rollbar, Stackdriverâ€¦ **[1 point]**
> How did you achieve this?

### Log management

- [ ] Mention everything you put in place for a better debugging experience based on the logs collection and analysis. **[3 points]**
> How did you achieve this?

- [ ] Mention everything you put in place to ensure no sensitive data were recorded to the log. **[1 point]**
> How did you achieve this?

### Asynchronous first

- [x] Always use the async implementations when available. **[1 point]** ðŸ”µ
> List all the functions you call in their async implementation instead of the sync one.
> 
> Ex: I used `await fs.readFile` in file `folder/xxx.ts:120` instead of `fs.readFileSync`.

I used `await genSalt()` in file `src\models\Users.ts` instead of `genSaltSync` in line 33.

I used `await hash()` in file `src\models\Users.ts` instead of `hashSync` in line 34.

I used `await ` in file `src\models\Users.ts` instead of `` in line 00.

Also in all Fastify route definitions I used 

- [ ] No unhandled promise rejections, no uncaught exceptionsâ€¦ **[1 point]** ðŸ”µ
> For example, how do you ensure every promise rejection is caught and properly handled?
> Tips: one part of the answer could be the use of a linter.

### Code quality

- [x] Did you put a focus on reducing code duplication? **[1 point]**
> How did you achieve this?

I achieved this by modularizing my application and always having the DRY methodology behnd my head everytime.
For example I have a models folder which is used in both the test and dev databases. Instead of having user and user_test tables/models, I only have one user model which I used throughout the app.
Also created a shared fastify server in `src\lib\fastify.ts` which is being used for both dev run and test runs.

- [x] Eslint rules are checked for any pushed commit to develop or master branch. **[1 point]**
> Please provide a link to the sample of Github Action logs (or similar).

For every push to master I have a github action that runs the linter to check and log for any errors and warnings.

### Automated tests

- [ ] You implemented automated specs. **[1 point]** ðŸ”µ
> Please provide a link to the more complete summary you have.

- [ ] Your test code coverage is 75% or more.  **[1 point]** ðŸ”µ
> Please provide a link to the `istanbul` HTML coverage summary (or from a similar tool).

- [ ] Do you run the test on a CD/CI, such as Github Action? **[1 point]**
> Please provide a link to the latest test summary you have, hosted on Github Action or similar.
